# Contribution Guidelines
## Pull Requests
Your pull request should increase a basic description of the proposed changes and any necessary links. It should also be well-documented.

## Code
Code contributions should meet the following standards:
1. We will use one space after the // in comments, block comments should use /* */
2. Naming conventions: Classes will use PascalCase, all other definitions (methods, variables, etc.) will use camelCase.
3. Loops will use the variables i, j, and k unless a more descriptive variable name is chosen. (With i always being the outer loop and so forth).
4. We will include one blank line between functions
5. We will include a header with the following information for each file: (1) name of the file, (2) data file was last updated, (3) author(s) of the file
6. All code will be stored on GitHub. All other documents will be placed in the shared Google Drive.
7. There will be at least one comment describing every function and class. (with additional lines where needed). Complex lines of code that cannot be understood implicitly (math formulae, regex expressions, etc.) should also get inline comments.
8. Comments will be placed before the line of code (and not at the end of lines) â€“ unless the line is very short, such as in the case of variable declarations
We will be using Kotlin.
