## Details
Solve grid-based puzzles filled with popcorn kernels. Follow numbers that indicate how many adjacent kernels there are. If you click a kernel, the grid erupts and you lose. Unique to this application is a settings menu, where you can launch game modes of increasing difficulty and track your progress, including your best time as well as a 5-star scoring system. Can you get 5 stars on all game modes?
